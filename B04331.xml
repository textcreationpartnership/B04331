            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Though others are contented to acquieſce in traditional noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and jog on in the common road, as being moſt eaſie and beaten; and to look upon the inquiries and determinations of our Anceſtors, as a

                  <p>But I would not be mistaken, as if I contemned the works of other men, endeavouring to build upon their ruines; I have as great a regard to all the Learned in this Faculty as any whatſoever; and am ſo far from blaſting any one, that I would rather ſmother then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly blaze their errours: but where neceſſity compells me (for truths ſake) I am blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when I name ſome: nor is it to be look'd upon as a defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

                  <p>And the ſame author in another place, creating of the life of man, ſaith, <hi>vita humana eſt lux formalis,</hi> life is a formal light: and if we admit of this Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all vital operations or actions are emanations and ſtreams iſſuing from this formal light, ſo that

                  <p>Theſe vital principles are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe principles are not equal in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and power, but one is principal and more noble than the other, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental and ſubordinate: man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a mere animal, hath his vitality, or performeth his vital actions from theſe three principles; the ſenſitive or brutal ſoul, the vital ſpirit, and the ferments of<pb n="38" facs="tcp:174182:28"/>the parts; theſe are joint agents in vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and co-operate conſentaneouſly have their defections, and roboration ſympath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Venus, &amp;c.</hi> the ſoul is ſad, heavy, and drooping, the ferments not ſo acute and active in their ſeveral offices of tranſmutation: if the ferments be alienated from their genuine proprieties, by improper, irregular, and diſproportionate food, or otherwiſe; or ſpontaneouſly languiſhing through their innate diſability to a longer duration in their integrities; ſoon follows a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depauperation, and drooping of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; ſince their generation and ſupply, depends upon a vigorous and due fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in the grand elaboratories of tranſmutation.</p>
                  <p>Thus the vital principles in a due har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concur and conſent in all vital operations; each being aſſiſtant and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjuvant one to the other, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating in the ill or welfare of one another:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:174182:28"/>but any one diſordered or depreſſed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the regular oeconomy of the vital functions, tending to ruine and decay of the whole frame of man body: this is the golden chain of health, one link whereof being broken, en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What is Health, but a due performance of all the Functions? What is Sickneſs, but their diſorder, irregularity, and defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency? and both health and ſickneſs depend upon theſe fundamental principles, ſince all the functions are performed approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately and immediately, duly or unduly, from their regularity or depravation.</p>

                  <p>IN the number of Conſumptions a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Fever juſtly deſerves to be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it is called a Hectick
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> becauſe it poſſeſſeth the habit of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This kind of Conſumption ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acts its part alone; but always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies a Phthiſis or Conſumption Phthiſical: Much talk there is of this Conſumption, but few there are that rightly underſtand the nature of it.</p>
                  <p>A Hectick or habitual Fever, is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency and inquietude of the <hi>Archae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us membrorum</hi> or innate vital ſpirit in the ſolid parts, procured by ſome offenſive cauſe; whereby the rorid ſubſtance of the body is waſted, and nutrition fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>It is called a Fever Hectick or habitual, becauſe it is more fixed and radicated in the ſolid parts then other Fevers, that are ſeated in the humours; and may well be called a Conſumption, becauſe it waſtes the body and vital ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is the remains of a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fever, or other, a long Fever ill cured:<pb n="55" facs="tcp:174182:36"/>ſometime it is procured by long paſſions of a troubled mind, continually keeping the ſpirits in inquietude and diſturbance. But of the cauſes hereafter.</p>
                  <p>There are 3 degrees or gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of a Hectick Fever diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and to be known by certain ſigns or ſymptomes that diſcover them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt degree or beginning of it is, <hi>quando humiditas aliment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>The ſecond degree is an augmentation and increaſe of the firſt; <hi>quando <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>

                        </gap> reparabilis;</hi> the body is lean, thin and poor; the intemperature of heat greater and conſtant, apparently at all times; with a quick ſharp pulſe; not ſo lively as before, but ſluggiſh, dull, and indiſpoſed to action either of body or mind: this degree is eaſily known, but not ſo eaſily cured; becauſe a putrid Fever is joyned with it.</p>
                  <p>The third degree is, when the body is<pb n="56" facs="tcp:174182:37"/>conſumed and waſted that no fleſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, but a dry wrinkled skin; the countenance changed, of a dead pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and hollow eyes: this degree is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> or <hi>Hectica Maraſmodes,</hi> accounted incurable; but I have ſeen ſome recover out of this deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that have been my Patients.</p>
                  <p>Phyſitians have divided the cauſes of a Hectick Fever into external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: External are all ſuch as procure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fevers, as vehement exerciſe, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming drinks and hot meats, immoderate excretions, as Diarrhaeas and Dyſenteries, vehement paſſions of the mind,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes nominated are burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or long Fevers; inflammation or ulcer of a part; or a putrid humour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein.</p>
                  <p>When a Hectick Fever or habitual fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile heat is induced or procured, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manifeſt cauſe, ſuch as are before mentioned, you may conclude a latent Scurvy; that the blood, that vital ſtream is defiled, alienated and changed from its nutritious balſamick ſtate; abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſaline, acid or acrid ſeroſity, does provoke the <hi>Archaeus membrorum</hi> to diſturbance and anger; and that <hi>calidum innatum</hi> which before was placid and<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174182:37"/>amicable, does now
<hi>efferveſcere,</hi> kindle and conſume the ſubſtance of the body, and deſtroy its own work: as a Candle burns clear, quietly, and undiſturbedly, ſo long as it is maintained with a ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous unctuous fit matter; but if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that Water, Vinegar, or ſuch liquor comes to it, preſently ſpatters, waſtes, and is unquiet until it be overcome.</p>
                  <p>In the enumeration of cauſes that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate a Hectick Fever, the Scurvy might well ſtand in the front, and lead up, as its proper place, being more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent than the reſt of its fellow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Yet I would not be miſtaken herein, but do allow ſuch refreſhing cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as the Patients inclination does crave, and finds benefit by; yet not to lay the ſtreſs of the Cure upon the conteſt of heat and cold.</p>
                  <p>Having laid open briefly what a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Fever is, the cauſes, and declarative ſigns, both proper, gradual, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing from other Fevers; it will be expected I ſhould ſay ſomething more of curation and preſervation, for the benefit of thoſe that are hectically inclined, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuch as are macerated and waſted thereby; ſo far as a general diſcourſe will admit, allowing peculiar caſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of individual conſtitutions, ſome variation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:174182:41"/>In chronick diſeaſes the diaetetick part rightly obſerved, is of great advantage; but in a Hectick Fever is ſpecially to be regarded. A ſweet, cleer air is of great advantage; it refreſheth the vital ſpirits, promotes tranſpiration of putrid vapours, and is very helpful in the Cure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it much concerns the Conſumptive perſon, what place he lives in; and that he be adviſed by a Phyſitian in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. At hot ſeaſons of the year, be not abroad in the heat of the day, but then keep in cool places; parching heat is very injurious, by drying the body and laſſating the ſpirits, both which your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe procures.</p>
                  <p>Uſe little, or no exerciſe; except at the beginning of your diſeaſe, or when it is in the firſt degree, your ſtrength will then allow it: but after the ſpirits are fretted, tyred and enfeebled by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant agitation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, motion or exerciſe provokes and aggravates:<note place="margin">Motus omnis calefacit corpora; quies vero refrigerat.</note> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them with reſt and eaſe, which will cool and abate their aeſtuation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered motion.</p>
                  <p>Cheriſh ſleep, although in the day time; that will humect and moiſten the<pb n="65" facs="tcp:174182:41"/>body, and reſtore the laſſated ſpirits: but lye not long in the morning, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains excrements beyond their due time for evacuation, and heats the body.</p>
                  <p>Watching and ſetting up late dries, and heats the body, by keeping the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſo long upon their duty; and is very injurious to Conſumptive perſons.</p>
                  <p>Avoid paſſions of the mind, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and waſte the ſpirits, exſiccate and dry the body; but endeavour a placid quiet mind, which refreſheth and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſpirits, and mitigates their febrile heat and aeſtuation: but cheriſh mirth, and recreate your ſelf abroad with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant company; and it will be of great advantage to you in regaining your health and loſt ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Bathing is good to cool and refreſh the ſpirits that are grown hot and fiery; to concenter them and give them reſt, that are tired by their continual aeſtuation; to reſtrain their efflux and emiſſion, where tranſpiration is too great: but this is to be underſtood of a cold Bath only, which does repell and drive in.</p>

This Lord being ſomething cheered at the merry talk of his ſervant, commanded him to give him a glaſs of wine; when he had drank that, was ſo well pleaſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with it, that he called for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and drank it, and then a third; after which his ſpirits were drowſie, and he lay down to ſleep; that night he ſlept very quietly, and the next day was very well, and his Fever gone: ſo he diſmiſſed his Phyſicians, and well rewarded his ſervant for his advice: And concludes the ſtory; <hi>Ecce quam noxia ſaepe eſt Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis pertinax ſcholaſticae methodi cuſtodia &amp; probroſa; aegris autem damnoſa!</hi>

Theſe and many more ſuch like pains in divers parts are cauſed from a degenerate acrid humor, extravaſated and expulſed from place to place, does chiefly invade and infeſt thoſe parts, whoſe innate robur and ſtrength is too weak and unable to reſiſt the aſſault, or by organical diſpoſition and aptitude is liable for the reception. In this deviation and inconſtant reſidence of morbifick humors, the Lungs is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently infeſted; ſometimes with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated blood, which if not timely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorated, does putrifie, and layes the foundation of a <hi>tabes;</hi> or a ſaline corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſerous humor, which by excoriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on invades the tender Lungs, and an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is planted there.</p>
                  <p>If we make inquiry into the cauſes of Phthiſical Conſumptions, we ſhall finde a phthiſis of the Lungs may be procured ſeveral wayes, or from theſe cauſes: Firſt, <hi>Domeſtica indiſpoſitio,</hi> a bad Craſis of the part; that is, a tender infirm conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the part apt to decay and corrupte and this is either native, or hereditary, from the firſt conſtitution and fabrication of parts by ſeminal matter; or adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,<pb n="83" facs="tcp:174182:50"/>acquired by time, through a bad air, noxious fumes, accidents, and evil living, diſpoſing the Lungs to a vitious depraved conſtitution. Secondly, by the accrimonious ſaltneſs of humors, fretting and exulcerating them. Thirdly, by the apertion, rupture, or eroſion of a Vein; which extravaſated blood lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, does putrifie and corrupt the Lungs. Fourthly, by an Impoſthume in the adjacent parts breaking in upon the Lungs; as by a Pluriſie, Squinance, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> or <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma;</hi> and therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid, <hi>Empyema ſi</hi> 40 <hi>dierum ſpatio per ſputum non repurgetur, in tabem degenerat, quae mortem accerſit.</hi> Aph. 15. Sect. 5.</p>
                  <p>Cauſes alſo external do promote and concur much to the generating of a Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis in the Lungs; and here you muſt take notice of the air, by whoſe intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs and impurity the Lungs contract an evil diſpoſition and alteration of its Craſis: and this we obſerve in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the air does procure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Phthiſical Conſumption of the Lungs more frequently; and that the air of another place is more preſervative and curative: therefore the Phthiſical perſon is to conſult the Phyſician what place is<pb n="84" facs="tcp:174182:51"/>beſt for his abode, whether it be for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or recovery: For this cauſe, great Cities being much annoyed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome fumes and vapours, from Sinks, Privies, and Chimnies, offenſive naſty Trades, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made
<hi>London</hi> abound with Phthiſical Conſumptive perſons more then half the Nation beſides; and from Conſumptive Parents a numerous progeny of the ſame kind is propagated. Society alſo is to be regarded; and you muſt not frequently converſe with a Phthiſical perſon, whoſe unwholeſome breath may infect the ſound, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the putrid vapour that the other breaths forth: but above all, a Phthiſical Bed-fellow is moſt dangerous to infect a ſound perſon, and chiefly to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Certain ſeaſons of the year, and conſtitution of the air, though in the ſame place, are worſe then other; as the Autumnal Quarter is the worſt, and Phthiſical perſons do moſt decline at this ſeaſon, and are worſe in moiſt foggy weather, then in a dry clear open sky.</p>
                  <p>That you may not be ſurprized, but have ſome warning of this Diſeaſe, and characters to know it by, I ſhall ſet down ſome ſignal tokens whereby you<pb n="85" facs="tcp:174182:51"/>may diſcover it afar off; and certain marks to know it by, when fixed and ſeated in its proper place.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:174182:55"/>and are much more frequent then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I ſhall wave many circumſtances concerning the cuſtom of taking it, and only tell you the nature and effects of it. Tobacco is of a virulent nature, as thoſe that firſt uſe it do find by the ſymptomes and effects, to be very like thoſe that have taken ſome venomous thing; as Giddineſs, Vomiting, Fainting; but the frequent uſe of it reconciles the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt that nature hath againſt it: as it is recorded by Hiſtorians, that
<hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> accuſtoming himſelf to eat poiſon, could not be poiſoned when he deſired it: ſo Tobacco though abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Nature, yet Cuſtom makes it ſo familiar, that the ill effects of it do not appear preſently; that nature is not ſo provoked, and ſenſibly moved by it; which puts the cheat upon all, thinking it then friendly and amicable, but by time does much alter the hate and condition of our Bodies. The fume of it is Narcotick, ſeiſing the ſpirits, and alienating their purity: It is acrid and biting, ingrateful to the tender Lungs, drawing away the dulcid moiſture, and leaving the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more fretting and acrimonious. Many take it to prevent Rheumes, but you may obſerve none ſo rheumatick and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick<pb n="93" facs="tcp:174182:55"/>as Tobacconiſts; and as it leaves a filthy taſte in the mouth, ſo it ſets a bad impreſſion upon all the parts it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; the Lungs and vital parts eſpecially receiving the prejudice.</p>
                  <p>Having made a progreſs thus far into Phthiſical Conſumptions, it remains I ſhould give you ſomething remarkable in the therapeutick or curative part.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe be but approaching, and a propenſion thereto, correction and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the maſs of Blood ſecures you from the danger; but if it be already ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Lungs ulcerated, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of cure muſt be proſecuted, as abſterſion and conſolidation.</p>
                  <p>To know whether your Diſeaſe increaſe or abate, during the cure and uſe of means, obſerve your Spittle, which will vary as you grow better or worſe; if that which was ſoul become more pure, or conſiſting of ſeveral parts be equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted; that was ſaltiſh, is dulcid or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid; that was faetid and ill ſavoured, is void of ſcent; that was with difficulty expectorated, is now eaſily brought up: theſe are good ſignes, and promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>covery; but the contrary are bad, and threaten death.</p>

                  <head>Of a Spermatick Conſumption.</head>
                  <p>THis kind of Conſumption may ſeem ſtrange in regard of the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being new; but it is very proper, and deſerves this diſtinguiſhing title.</p>
                  <p>By a Spermarick Conſumption you are to underſtand, a decay and waſting of the body, from the expence and loſs of ſperm or ſeed; and this is either volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary by immoderate coition and copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, man with woman; or by ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to ſuch an expence and emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or elſe involuntary, a weeping and iſſuing without conſent, or external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and allurement.</p>
                  <p>Firſt we will conſider what this ſperm or balſom of Nature is in both Sexes; that knowing the worth of it, how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually it is elaborated and brought to its perfection, you may the better value it, be more ſenſible of the loſs, and rightly underſtand how the detriment and decay does conſecute and follow upon too large, and continued emiſſion.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here ſpend time in leading you through all the digeſtions of mans<pb n="99" facs="tcp:174182:58"/>body that are praevious and preparatory to this ultimate elixerated matter, having done that in another place: but it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient you underſtand that this ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>ſuccus</hi> being the laſt concocted and elaborated matter, is the cream and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of the reſt; having been defaeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and depurated in ſeveral offices of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; each of which does ſeparate the faeculent and inutile parts, tranſmitting the purer to receive the operation and perfection of the ſubſequent digeſtion: and therefore this ſpermatick
<hi>ſuccus</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <hi>pars puriſſima, electiſsima &amp; elabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiſsima omnium partium animantium quae conferunt ad nutritionem;</hi> the pureſt and moſt ſelect matter, graduated and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſo many praevious digeſtions, which are as ſo many rectifications to ſubtiliate, purifie and ſpiritallize it. This ſpermatick digeſted matter, though the laſt in order, yet it is prime in dignity; being the quinteſſence and pureſt part extracted from the reſt, and may fitly be called <hi>elixir hominis</hi> or eſſential balſom. Now this elixerate choice matter which is elaborated and treaſured up in the ſpermatick veſſels, not only for uſe of the <hi>individuum,</hi> but alſo for propagation of the ſpecies, is not prodigally to be waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<pb n="100" facs="tcp:174182:59"/>but neceſſarily employed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes appointed by Nature: but if it happen from what cauſe ſoever to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended more then nature does allow, and can well diſpence with, damage does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to the whole body, enervation and conſumption upon the continuance, if not timely prevented and remedied.</p>
                  <p>The danger and prejudice from ſuch immoderate evacuations appears thus: For the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that it cauſeth great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and debility of all the faculties, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very prodigal that hath fooliſhly expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Natures Treaſure, can ſeal to this truth. The <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, why and how it comes to paſs, that ſuch decay is the conſequent of it, appears upon theſe following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the commerce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent between the Teſticles, the Brain and ſpinal Marrow: the emptying of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cauſeth an exhauſtion, and a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the latter; by drawing away the animal Spirits, which is their ſtrength and vigour; and from this debility of the back, venereous waſting was called <hi>tabes dorſalis,</hi> a Conſumption of the Back.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you conſider what this ſeed or ſpermatick ſubſtance is, the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſence<pb n="101" facs="tcp:174182:59"/>and pureſt part of our alimenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liquors of the body; the moſt refined and beſt rectified ſpirits, are extracted from the whole body, and drawn in by the ſpermatick veſſels to impregnate and endow this ſperm or ſeed: Now if it be ſo (as it is moſt true) that the ſeed or ſperm is an extract of the fineſt matter, and ſpirit of mans body; and that the emptying of the ſpermatick Veſſels puts them upon a new draining, and ſucking of the body to fill again, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leniſh their emptineſs (as the Stomach when it is empty, deſires to be filled again, and not lie idle): then of neceſſity it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that too large and frequent emiſſions of this ſeed doe exhauſt and inervate the body, debilitate all the faculties, and bring a conſumption upon the whole.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſpirits are balſamick, and preſerve the body from putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; their exhauſtion therefore makes the body liable to corruption and decay: and this is obſervable, that thoſe who ſuffer ſuch immoderate expence and loſs, it at changeth their complexion from a freſh lively aſpect, into a pale, brown, and ſad countenance.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From immederate expence of ſeed, and too frequent emiſſions, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth<pb n="102" facs="tcp:174182:60"/>infaecundity and ſterility; and that by reaſon the ſeed ſtayeth not, nor abideth in the ſpermatick elaboratory its due time for digeſtion, elixiration, and maturati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as alſo that the <hi>vis ſpermatopoietica,</hi> the ſpermatick ferment or craſis of thoſe parts are changed, altered, and become barren, their native power being ſpent by too frequent emiſſions, and immoderate Flux; as Land is become poor and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren by being over-tilled.</p>
                  <p>Theſe truths being rightly conſidered, as it is rationally apparent, none will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully (I ſuppoſe being thus warned) will be guilty in this kind: but it happens ſometimes by inadvertency, natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or hazardous adventures with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in copulation, that a detrimental and conſumptive iſſuing and dropping of Seed is procured upon man or woman, by ſtraining beyond their ſtrength; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome Bed-fellow, or a fluid indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted waterineſs of the ſeed from weakneſs and debility of the genital parts.</p>
                  <p>That which doth proceed from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure copulation, and is virulent, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the colour, greeniſh, yellowiſh,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt have a peculiar cure, oppoſing that malignity and virulency wherewith<pb n="103" facs="tcp:174182:60"/>the craſis of the ſpermatick veſſels are tainted and ſtained; afterwards robora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrengthening of the parts, to confirm their native craſis and ſpermatick power reſtored again: but if unadviſedly (as ſome ignorant practitioners common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do) you ſtop the current and iſſuing of the ſeed, before there be a through puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then the malignity is retained, and being ſtopt in the uſual vent, regur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitates back, and is ſcattered all over the body, producing dolorous and very bad effects: and thus the common pretenders that boaſt of theſe Cures with ſpeed and infallibility, leave their Patients in a worſe condition then when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them: and not only their method and intentions of Cure are irregular and injurious, but alſo their Medicines dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or ineffectual for want of skill in pharmacy and Chymical Preparations, or a careleſs referring that charge and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement to others. For my own part I dare not give a Medicine, but what I am an eye-witneſs to in the preparation, it being the great work and charge of a Phyſician ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my purpoſe; by too frequent copulation, immoderate ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the like, weakening the parts for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:174182:61"/>generation, a <hi>profluvium ſeminis</hi> or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea, an iſſuing of ſeed may follow, which although your partner be whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, may produce bad effects and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come virulent; for although the flux at firſt be mild and white, yet by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and neglect, does degenerate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſharp and ill coloured, ſhewing the pravity of its alienated nature: from whence a Cachexy or ill habit of body, weakneſs, conſumptive leanneſs, and a much altered Countenance.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>ſtillicidium ſeminis,</hi> involuntary dropping and waſting of ſeed in men is eaſily known; but in women often miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (and that by Phyſicians,) thinking it to be <hi>fluor albus,</hi> the whites; thereupon fall to bleeding, and purging ſoundly, with baſe virulent Catharticks, which exaſperates and renders the diſeaſe more deplorable, and far worſe to be cured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch rude dealing.</p>
                  <p>But he that rightly underſtands the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; that is
<hi>filius artis</hi> in Chymical Pharmacy (as Dr. <hi>George Thomſon,</hi> a true Spagyriſt that labours <hi>propriis manibus</hi> for efficacious medicines) ſuch I ſay, goes another way to work, by reſtoring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with roborating extracts and balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick elixerated ſpirits: with which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<pb n="105" facs="tcp:174182:61"/>cloſeth and receives amicably; by whoſe aſſiſtance the debilitated parts gain ſtrength, concoct and retain what before paſſed away crude, watery and thin.</p>
                  <p>This weakneſs is very frequent among the feminine ſex; being more prone and apt to this waſting infirmity then men, from the difference of organization and fabrication of parts rendring them more liable; being the colder and moiſter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the retentive faculty weaker: Some conceal this infirmity out of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; others neglect it as a trivial diſeaſe, that time will cure, not conſidering the ill conſequents that this produceth; as great weakneſs of the brain and marrow of the back; debility of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and trembling of the nerves, decay of the ſenſes, and

                  <p>Theſe ſad effects I have often obſerved
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:174182:62"/>to be procured by this ſecret waſting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe in many perſons; the particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and circumſtances I ſhall not recite for modeſty ſake, but caution all ſuch as are threatned with it, to ſeek for the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and efficacious means in time; and not cheat themſelves (as too frequently) with the uſual notion of the whites, and the frivolous common medicines that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tell to each other. The medicines I uſe in the Cure of this infirmity both of men and women, as a reſtaurative eſſence, and roborating extract, are not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged for the reaſons aforeſaid; which I think will ſatisfie all that are reaſonable, and for others 'tis no matter.</p>
                  <p>I have now diſcourſed the ſeveral ſorts of Conſumptions propoſed to be treated on in the front of this Book; and had not the late dreadful fire conſumed my houſe and interrupted theſe labours, I had enlarged this work in ſeveral parts of it, and given you a fuller proſpect into the matter: yet as it is, you may ſee a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſome neceſſary truths, that have been latent; and the foundation of theſe diſeaſes that were undiſcovered, are now laid bare and obvious to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                  <p>IN vain it is to Diſcourſe, and have the Nation of Diſeaſes; unleſs alſo efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Medicines be found out to anſwer their Indications for Cure: Which to do is the moſt difficult and laborious part of Phyſick. And this we may conclude from the often fruſtration and diſappointment of Medicines in their effects, after Learned Conſultations and deliberate Determination of the Diſeaſe, Cauſes, Part affected,

                  <p>Here is the great Check given to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians Learning; and, until this tryal of the Medicine, he receives no repulſe, but goes on ſmoothly with Applauſe and boldly: but, finding his Medicine take little or no effect for the purpoſe intended, is then at a ſtand a while: But, being loth to receive a baffle from the Diſeaſe does preſcribe another, and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Diſappointment is too often obſerved in the practice of Phyſick, and this ariſing only from ineffectual, languid erroneous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and how does this come to paſs? but that the care and burthen of this work reſts upon thoſe that are unable and unfit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it: or by truſting too much the credit of Authors and their traditional Medicines, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Galenical or Chymical; relying upon their authority, and the truth of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which have deluded and fruſtrated the expectation of many.

                  <p>PUrgation or Clenſing is praemitted as a regular and due courſe in the cure of moſt Diſeaſes; and it is inſtituted, chiefly to cleanſe the firſt region of the body, and to carry off what ſuperfluous or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate matter is to be voided by the gutts: And this operation is neceſſary in the cure of moſt Diſeaſes, though ſeated in other parts; for, although the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity lye not in the firſt region of the body, neither in the Stomack, Gall, Gutts, Meſentery, Liver, nor Splene; yet 'tis aggravated, if thoſe parts be foul: and probably may be the original and foundation of thoſe remote infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, by conſent or tranſmiſſion; nor ſhall medicine carry its vertue without impediment and abatement, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Scurvy (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the former part of that Book) is complicated and joins with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſeaſes, Scorbutic Dropſies, Scorbutic Feavers, Aſthmaes, Palſies, Gouts, Scorbutic Conſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that a particular medicine for this or that humor, being too narrow, and not adaequate to the latitude of the diſeaſe, will take no effect in many Scorbutic perſons: but ſuch as are radical and graduated in univerſality, are the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful<pb n="4" facs="tcp:174182:71"/>and laudable medicines; I have therefore framed and improved this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to anſwer the intents of Purgation, in all Scorbutick perſons and caſes, and is the beſt purgative medicine, both in the manner of operation, and the effects, that ever I uſed, or read of.</p>

At a fortnights end, her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack was much better both for appetite and digeſtion; at the months end ſhe was ſtronger and well able to go, very chearful, and eat her meat with delight; her Complexion altered much for the better, and about the ſixth week ſhe improved in fleſh, and began to be ſomething plump and full; then I bad<pb n="7" facs="tcp:174182:72"/>her deſiſt from her Pills, but continue the

                  <p>I might inſtance in many more caſes wherein this Medicine hath done me good ſervice, but that would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to relate: therefore in general I muſt ſay, for Sorbutic perſons, and the various Symptoms that attend that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, whether in this part, or that part; theſe Pills are the beſt Abſterſive and Purgative Medicine I ever made uſe of, being ſo amicable and friendly to nature, in their Operation, performing with ſo much eaſe and gentleneſs, that I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to the weakeſt bodies with good ſucceſs, proportioning the doſe according to the ability of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:174182:75"/>I ſhall here ſet down the Doſe and Circumſtances that belong to the taking of theſe Pills.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary Doſe for man, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is three Pills; ſome Bodies (though very ſeldom) require four: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two Pills is ſufficient, for weak bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſuch as work freely with a ſmall matter.</p>
                  <p>So much difference there is in bodies for purging, that two of theſe Pills are ſufficient for ſome; but moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three Pills are required, ſeldom four: therefore try your body firſt, with a leſſer Doſe then, if it require more, you may add to the next; and in ſo doing you will not err: For example, If you have a ſtubborn body, difficult and hard to purge, and the firſt Doſe works but little, the next Doſe you may take one Pill more:<note place="margin">Tutius eſt peccare in defectu, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in exceſſu.</note> but if you have a lax gentle body freer in Operation than you expected, then abate a Pill, if the firſt work too nimbly with you. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of bodies is ſuch in Operation, (eſpecially purging) that they require a different Doſe, or quantity for their proportion, which cannot ſo exactly be determined and appointed by the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience<pb n="14" facs="tcp:174182:76"/>of the moſt skilful Phyſician, but by a rational Conjecture; untill the firſt experiment and tryal of their bodies, (which uncertainty, is not in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, but in the diverſity of bodies); and after the firſt Doſe taken, your own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then, conſidering the condition of your body with the former, will prompt you in the next, whether to keep to the ſame, to augment, or abate.<note n="*" place="margin">Solutiva enim fortia cum ſuccis exuperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum laci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem.</note> And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this as a neceſſary cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you covet not ſtrong Purges and large Evacuations, to have many ſtools in a day (a common error) which offers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Nature, and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſweeping down both good and bad together;<note n="*" place="margin">Eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuatio op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timè per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plures per ſicitur eva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuationes minorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas.</note> but rather chooſe to draw away the offending matter gently by degrees, giving Nature time for ſeparation, the pure from the impure and noxious: four or five Stools in a day is ſufficient, but not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſix; and that number I intend you to aim at and no more; and thus doing, you will find Phyſick much more beneficial, nature<pb n="15" facs="tcp:174182:76"/>more kindly aſſiſting, and not at all weakned.</p>

                  <p>Concerning preparation before Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much talked of; take this Advice: that ſoluble bodies, readily yeilding obedience to gentle Purging Medicines, need no other preparation than what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath provided in the diſpoſition of their own bodies; but for thoſe bodies that are more hot, dry, coſtive and very ſtubborn in Operation, it will be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to facilitate their Purgation, by eating ſtewed prunes, water grewel, or barley broth with raiſins and currants, or by drinking whey, or ſider, two or three daies before, which will prepare, moiſten, cool, and open your body, and make it more ſoluble and eaſy in purging.</p>
                  <p>The times for taking theſe Pills ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:174182:77"/>is thus, (except good reaſon, in ſome bodies, perſwade the contrary:) Take one Pill over night going to bed, having eaten but a light Supper at ſix of the clock before; the next morning early in bed, take the remaining part of the Doſe; and you may ſleep an hour after if you be diſpoſed, but not longer; nor lie long in bed after, leſt you check the Operation of the Medicine, and thereby cauſe you to be ſickiſh at Stomack in your riſing: when you are up, drink a little warm poſſet-drink, made of ſmall bear, or ſmall Ale, or thin broth for this purpoſe, and forbear eating until noon: but although theſe Pills are appointed to be taken, one over night, the other in the morning; yet if you find any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience thereby, you may take the whole Doſe in the morning very early, and lie two hours after: But if you have not a juſt cauſe for alteration obſerve the Preſcription.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Pills take thus every fourth or fifth day, and you will find it beſt to give ſuch intermiſſion: Chronick or old Diſeaſes muſt have time to be Eradicated, and you muſt reduce nature from an ill<pb n="17" facs="tcp:174182:77"/>habit by degrees,<note n="*" place="margin">Semper expedit paulatim ducere qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>One Caſe amongſt the reſt, relating hither, I well remember, which I think good to relate: A woman that had been troubled with the Scurvy for ſome years though ſcarce taken notice of, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be from other cauſes, what ſymptoms did appear; amongſt the reſt, for ſome time ſhe was moleſted, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a morning with a drineſs in her mouth, and an ill taſte; afterwards her ſtomack would nauſeate ſometimes, and ſoon after did begin to vomit: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe took ſeveral medicines to ſtay vomiting, and to ſtrengthen the ſtomack, but all in vain, and rather aggravated<pb n="25" facs="tcp:174182:81"/>her Griefs, ſtraining to Vomit with more violence, and little or nothing came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: when I was made acquainted with it, and underſtanding the Symptoms to ariſe from the Scurvy; upon examination of the whole matter, I ſent her this <hi>Elixir</hi> with directions; and at the third or fourth Doſe, her Vomiting and nauſeating was gone, and much at eaſe: then I appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the Scorbute-Pills, to be uſed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittingly with this <hi>Elixir</hi> for ſome time; and ſoon after, the other Scorbutic Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which moleſted her, vaniſhed, and ſhe regained her former health: Whereby you may obſerve that the Scurvy will not be tamed but by Anti-ſcorbatic Medicines: and although ſome Symptoms of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy be common and like with thoſe from other diſeaſes, whereby many are deceived in their cauſes: yet, if they ariſe from a Scorbutic Root, they will not be cure but by Anti-ſcorbutic Medicines; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what Symptoms of Sickneſs do appear in any perſon, ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:174182:83"/>breathing was not in the Breaſt, but by Compreſſion of the Diaphragma, from a turgid aeſtuation of Scorbutic matter, which threatned Suffocation ſomtimes: (And upon this very cauſe, I knew a very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor of Phyſick, that died ſuddainly in his bed): I peruſed and made inſpection into the Urine, and examined his Pulſe, as now and formerly; both which conſented to, and confirmed the Scurvy: Then I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, what Medicines had been given him; and thoſe were moſt Pectoral, except ſome churliſh Purges, after which he was much w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rſe, and began to ſwell; and now he was about to take a Dyet-drink for the Dropſy, which was like to prove as the reſt: but the Patient committing himſelf into my hands, I had him deſiſt from all Medicines but what I appointed; and firſt I gave him this <hi>Elixir</hi> (he being very weak) which as a Cordial did revive him, and after a few daies was much altered for the better, and ſlept more quietly, with a greater freedom in breathing: he continued this alone, for ten dayes; in which time he gained ſtrength and had a ſtomack to his meat: then I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him the uſe of the Scorbute-Pills, which abated the ſwelling of his Limbs at twice taking, and preceeded in the uſe of theſe two Medicines. Laſtly, I appointed<pb n="29" facs="tcp:174182:83"/>him the Sudorific Medicine hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and in a ſhort time, he was reduced by this courſe to good health and free from his former Complaints. By the whole Story you may obſerve, Firſt, that the Scurvy is diſguiſed, and appears in the ſhape of other Diſeaſes. Secondly, that thoſe Diſeaſes ſo counterfeited, are not cured but by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Medicines which are Anti-ſcorbutic: and therefore it much concerns the Sick, that their Diſeaſes be rightly ſtated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by one that can make a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Diſcovery; and not according to external Appearance, and common Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which is very Fallacious.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to let you know farther, How and wherein this
<hi>Elixir</hi> is uſeful to me in Practice; and that in ſuddain emergent caſes of fainting: as alſo in Languiſhing Diſeaſes, and Caſes of Extremity when the Patient is ſpent and brought ſo low that no Phyſick can be Adminiſtred; this, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſupport to the Languiſhing decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faculties, may daily be exhibited; and this I have frequently proved: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Perſon of Honour, given over by his Phyſicians, being ſpent and decayed and highly ſwoln in a Scorbutic Aſthma and Dropſy, was gaſping for breath, when I came to him; but exhibiting this
<hi>Elixir,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:174182:84"/>he did wonderfully revive, and his difficult &amp; ſhort breathing was much enlarged and eaſed for a few daies, for which he did Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the Medicine: but, being paſt the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Recovery, and incapable of other Medicines, requiſite or Cure, he dyed.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may object: This poſſibly may be a good Medicine in deſperate Caſes, and approaches of Death; but how can it be proper and fit for a man that can eat his meat well, and walk abroad, only inclining to the Scurvy, and ſome ſmall Impediments from thence? I anſwer: That Medicine which is endowed with ſo much Vertue, to bring relief to a decayed or dying man; muſt needs be of great power and efficacy, to give Vigour and ſtrength to all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: Now Scorbutic Infirmities, or imped mens of what fort ſoever, do ariſe from the Imbecillity, Aberration, or Declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Faculty in the Body, injured or decayed which requires a generous and noble Medicine to Rectifie and Vigorate, (at leaſt, it will better be performed by ſuch) not a languid dull Medicine; and therefore this Objection is vain; for the greater power a Medicine hath, the more likely and better to do the buſineſs be it little or much: and therefore if your Caſe require help, do it by an acute Vigorous<pb n="31" facs="tcp:174182:84"/>Medicine, and you may expect your Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to be removed, <hi>Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>I have briefly ſhewed you the power and properties belonging to an Anti-ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic Medicine, requiſite to be uſed in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scurvy: ſuch a Medicine I ſay is required; tis not Purging alone will do it, but other Operations muſt joyn to effect the purpoſe. For advice and rules to thoſe that uſe this Catholick <hi>Elixir</hi> (living farr diſtant from me) that they may not Erre in the taking of it, let them obſerve as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>That in the uſe of this <hi>Elixir</hi> with the Scorbute-Pills, it is beſt to begin with the Pills; except the perſon be very weak, or ſpent, and firſt require ſome ſtrengthing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:174182:85"/>and reviving Medicine, then you may firſt begin with the
<hi>Elixir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo that this <hi>Elixir</hi> is not to be taken thoſe daies you Purge, but every Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting day between Purging.</p>
                  <p>That this <hi>Elixir</hi> is not to be taken or taſted alone but mixt with ſome good Liquor, and that ought to be the beſt Canary; for bad Wine alters and abates the Virtue of the Medicine. It may be taken in French-wine, if the Patient cannot agreee with Sack.</p>
                  <p>The Doſe for man or woman, is thirty drops: for ten years old, twenty drops; for five years, ten drops.</p>
                  <p>And obſerve this; that at the firſt taking you begin but with half the Doſe that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for your age; as thus: thirty drops is appointed for a man, let him begin with fifteen or ſixteen drops, and then augment two or three drops every day after, until he aſcend to thirty, and then there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue that Doſe afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Take it (in Bed if you be weak) in a ſpoonful of Sack, every morning, faſting an hour and half after; and at five of the Clock After-noon; but you are not ſo ſtrictly to obſerve the after-noons, but, if that your occaſions do not well permit (as when you muſt be abroad or the like,) you may omit.</p>

                  <p>Some there are that deceive themſelves, and lay the whole ſtreſs of the Cure upon Purging, and that they proſecute very often (and it were well if the purgatives be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) but the effects may inform and tell them, that there is ſomething elſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; and they find it ſo. The Scurvy is not ſo eaſily diſlodged and thrown out by a ſingle Operation of Medicine; but requires rectifying and ſtrengthning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive Faculties alſo, and depuration of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>The Body of man is perſpirable, and in his due ſtate of health continually more or leſs doth tranſpire and breath out humid vapours and a ſuperfluous moiſture by the Pores of the Body; hereby the Maſs of Blood and habit of the Body is cleanſed and diſcharged of that which is ſuperfluous or impure and unfit to be retained; and this inſenſible Evacuation is ſo requiſite, that without tranſpiration the Maſs of Blood cannot be depurated, but remains muddy and defiled, which forceth Nature to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered<pb n="35" facs="tcp:174182:86"/>fermentation and morbific Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Proper and amicable Purgation doth well, acts a good part, and ought to be prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in moſt caſes, which alone do check a Diſeaſe and leſſen it, by carrying off a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Elixir,</hi> and Sudoriſic Extract to be uſed in that order and method as the Medicines and her Condition required: at the months end ſhe gained the uſe of her Limbs, but were ſomething weak; yet no pains as formerly: and upon the uſe of the Sudorific Extract, ſome ſpots were driven forth, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Scurvy did appear and ſatisfied them more fully, what I had determined of her diſeaſe: The Winter being very ſharp, did ſometimes interrupt her Courſe, and retarded the compleating of a Cure, which

                  <p>This Sudorific Medicine prepared for the purpoſes aforeſaid.

A young gentlewoman of a fair Complexion and very clear skin, by Melancholy (and other cauſes) was much altered and become brown, muddy, and diſcoloured in particular places; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a Scurf did ariſe and ſome Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here and there, which was troubleſome by itching: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon I was ſent for, and examined the whole matter; and finding the acuteneſs of her ſickneſs to ariſe from an imprudent repelling of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and forcing it back upon Nature, which ſhe had brought forth to the skin; I immediately appointed her a Doſe of my ſudorific Extract to be given her, which put her into a breathing Sweat; and when the Medicine had done its Operation, her pains and ſickneſs were almoſt gone: the next day I appointed another Doſe to be given her, to ſweat gently for two or three hours, and before the Operation of the Medicine was ſpent, her pain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That you may know when a Sudorific Medicine is required as neceſſary, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Cure, I'le tell you in what caſes I appoint this Sudorific Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to be taken: In curing the Scurvy, I find good ſucceſs thereby, to cleanſe and purifie the Blood that is degenerate and vitiated with a Scorbutic taint and impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: or when the Pores are occluded and imperſpirable, the Body tumified and puft up for want of tranſpiration and ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
